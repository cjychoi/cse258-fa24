This project analyzes the Food.com dataset to predict recipe ratings from review texts using linear regression with ridge regularization and to classify user preferences (ratings ≥ 4) using a Random Forest classifier. The rating prediction model achieved an MSE of 1.2823, an MAE of 0.7039, and an R² score of 0.1793, while also identifying the positivity of words in the reviews. The preference prediction model achieved an F1 score of 0.96 and highlighted the importance of personalized preferences.
