    "This dataset includes over 180K+ recipes and 700K+ recipe reviews spanning 18 years of user interactions and uploads on Food.com. For our analysis, we will utilize two files: **RAW_interactions.csv** and **RAW_recipes.csv**. We selected this dataset due to its rich and diverse information. Some of the interesting values included: \n",

    "- user_id: Unique user ID values\n",
    "- recipe_id: Unique recipe ID values\n",
    "- rating: Rating given from user (0~5 scale)\n",
    "- review: Review of the recipe (text)\n",

    "- tags: Food.com tags for each recipes\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "- **Dataset Characteristics:**\n",
    "    - The dataset is extensive, with over 230,000 recipes and 1.1 million interactions, making it robust for machine learning tasks like recommendation systems or rating predictions.\n",
    "    - The average number of ingredients per recipe (around 9.55) suggests that most recipes are relatively simple, with a manageable number of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rating Distribution:**\n",
    "    - The ratings are heavily skewed towards the highest score (5), which might indicate a bias in user reviews or a tendency for users to rate recipes they liked rather than disliked.\n",
    "    - The small number of ratings below 4 suggests that poorly received recipes may either not be reviewed often or that users prefer not to leave negative feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ingredients Popularity:**\n",
    "    - Common ingredients like salt, butter, sugar, and onion dominate the dataset, reflecting their foundational role in a wide variety of recipes.\n",
    "    - These ingredients are versatile and likely to appear in both simple and complex recipes, which might impact model predictions for recipe similarity or ingredient importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal Trends:**\n",
    "    - Recipe submissions peaked around 2007, reflecting either a surge in platform popularity or increased engagement during that period.\n",
    "    - The sharp decline after 2007 might be due to changes in platform usage, competition from other recipe-sharing platforms, or a reduction in user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights for Predictive Modeling:**\n",
    "    - The skewed rating distribution could pose challenges for regression models, requiring careful handling, such as rebalancing or weighted loss functions, to mitigate bias.\n",
    "    - The dominance of certain ingredients might mean they have less predictive power for ratings, as they are present in a large proportion of recipes.\n",
    "    - Temporal trends could be factored into models to study how recipe popularity or user engagement changed over time, which might also correlate with rating patterns.\n"

    "**Ingredient Overlap:**\n",
    "- Many of the recommended recipes have overlapping ingredients like salt, olive oil, and butter, which are common foundational ingredients.\n",
    "- This high overlap in foundational ingredients likely drives the similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- The recommendations are heavily influenced by the most commonly occurring ingredients (e.g., salt, olive oil), which could reduce diversity in recommendations.\n",
    "- Recipes with unique or specialized ingredients may not be well-represented due to their rarity in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Enhancements:**\n",
    "- Weighting ingredient importance could improve the diversity of recommendations by prioritizing unique ingredients over ubiquitous ones.\n",
    "- Incorporating additional features such as tags, preparation steps, or user ratings could refine the recommendation system.\n",

    "### Evaluation of Predictive Task\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:**\n",
    "- The recommendations are evaluated qualitatively by examining the relevance of the similar recipes.\n",
    "- Quantitative evaluation can include precision and recall by comparing recommendations to user interaction data (if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline:**\n",
    "- Random recipe recommendations serve as the baseline for comparison. The Jaccard Similarity-based system outperforms this by providing contextually similar recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validity:**\n",
    "- The approach is valid as it directly leverages shared ingredient sets, which align with user expectations for similar recipes."
