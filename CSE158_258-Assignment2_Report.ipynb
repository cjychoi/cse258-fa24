    "This dataset includes over 180K+ recipes and 700K+ recipe reviews spanning 18 years of user interactions and uploads on Food.com. For our analysis, we will utilize two files: **RAW_interactions.csv** and **RAW_recipes.csv**. We selected this dataset due to its rich and diverse information. Some of the interesting values included: \n",

    "From the first glance, a lot of values seemed to have interesting correlations to each other, such as 'minutes', 'n_steps', and 'n_ingredients' may affect the user's 'rating' because it could be a burden to cook a complicated recipe and may lead to a lower rating.\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "- Dataset Characteristics:\n",
    "    - The dataset is extensive, with over 230,000 recipes and 1.1 million interactions, making it robust for machine learning tasks like recommendation systems or rating predictions.\n",
    "    - The average number of ingredients per recipe (around 9.55) suggests that most recipes are relatively simple, with a manageable number of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rating Distribution:\n",
    "    - The ratings are heavily skewed towards the highest score (5), which might indicate a bias in user reviews or a tendency for users to rate recipes they liked rather than disliked.\n",
    "    - The small number of ratings below 4 suggests that poorly received recipes may either not be reviewed often or that users prefer not to leave negative feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ingredients Popularity:\n",
    "    - Common ingredients like salt, butter, sugar, and onion dominate the dataset, reflecting their foundational role in a wide variety of recipes.\n",
    "    - These ingredients are versatile and likely to appear in both simple and complex recipes, which might impact model predictions for recipe similarity or ingredient importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal Trends:\n",
    "    - Recipe submissions peaked around 2007, reflecting either a surge in platform popularity or increased engagement during that period.\n",
    "    - The sharp decline after 2007 might be due to changes in platform usage, competition from other recipe-sharing platforms, or a reduction in user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insights for Predictive Modeling:\n",
    "    - The skewed rating distribution could pose challenges for regression models, requiring careful handling, such as rebalancing or weighted loss functions, to mitigate bias.\n",
    "    - The dominance of certain ingredients might mean they have less predictive power for ratings, as they are present in a large proportion of recipes.\n",
    "    - Temporal trends could be factored into models to study how recipe popularity or user engagement changed over time, which might also correlate with rating patterns.\n"
